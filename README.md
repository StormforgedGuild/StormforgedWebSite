## Development

For Developing EQdkp Plus, we use trunk-based Development. This means that our development takes part at our master branch. For every major version, we create an own trunk. This means, that the master branch is unstable and the other version branches are stable. 

If you create Pull Requests, please do it for the master branch. We will then decide if it will be merged to the version branch.

You will find more information about the development, like tools or helpful Wiki articles [here](https://eqdkp-plus.eu/en/development.html)

## Reporting Bugs or requesting features

We don't use the GitHub issues here, but we have an own [Bugtracker](https://eqdkp-plus.eu/bugtracker/) where you can reports Bugs or request new features.
